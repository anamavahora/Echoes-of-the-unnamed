# 🧩 Echoes of the Unnamed

> A surreal mystery-puzzle game where memories blur, identities fragment, and truth is hidden beneath illusion.

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

You awaken as an unnamed consciousness in a digital void.  
Fragments of memory surround you — a broken photo, a ticking clock, whispers in the dark.  
Your only way forward is to piece together who you were... or discover who you truly are.

Every choice shifts your path. Every memory you collect shapes your ending.  
Are you the victim? The observer? The liar?
